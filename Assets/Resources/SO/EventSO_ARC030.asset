  description: The Archs have stumbled upon an intergalactic zoo housing the most
    bizarre creatures in the cosmos. It's a perfect opportunity for some 'unconventional'
    bio-research and a bit of extracurricular DNA shopping.
  tip: In the Archs' quest for dominance, sometimes you've got to mix and match your
    genes like a cosmic fashion show.
